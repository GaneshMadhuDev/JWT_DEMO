# JWT_DEMO

JSON WEB TOKENS:

Authentication: This is the typical scenario for using JWT, once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token. Single Sign On is a feature that widely uses JWT nowadays, because of its small overhead and its ability to be easily used among systems of different domains.


Information Exchange: JWTs are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties, because as they can be signed, for example using a public/private key pair, you can be sure that the sender is who they say they are. Additionally, as the signature is calculated using the header and the payload, you can also verify that the content hasn’t changed.


JWTs consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are:

Header
Payload
Signature
Therefore, a JWT typically looks like the following.

xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz

Let’s break down the different parts.

Header
The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the hashing algorithm such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.

For example:

{
  'alg': 'HS256',
  'typ': 'JWT'
}
Then, this JSON is Base64Url encoded to form the first part of the JWT.
